## Added Features
The added feature is a profile page for each user that includes a profile picture, the username, and a custom biography that any authenticated user can view. In order to view a profile, the user must click on the username in a message on the home page. A user can only edit their own profile page and will only be able to view the option if they are logged in to their account.
